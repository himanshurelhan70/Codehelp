        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Linus Torvalds is a Finnish-American software engineer who is the creator
          and principal developer of the Linux kernel, which is the kernel for a
          number of operating systems. He also created the version control system
          Git. Torvalds was born on December 28, 1969 in Helsinki, Finland. He
          studied computer science at the University of Helsinki, and he developed
          the Linux kernel as a student project in 1991. Since then, the Linux
          kernel has become one of the most widely used kernels in the world,
          powering everything from smartphones to supercomputers.

            <strong>Linux</strong> is an open-source operating system like other operating systems such as Microsoft 
            Windows, Apple Mac OS, iOS, Google android, etc. An operating system is a software that enables the communication between 
            computer hardware and software. It conveys input to get processed by the processor and brings output to the hardware to display it. 
            This is the basic function of an operating system. Although it performs many other important tasks, let's not talk about that.
